# InstaSquare - A web app to bulk square photos for upload into Instagram

## Introduction
    $ This web app was created because my friend @ClarriseNg told me about her difficulties with bulk uploading photos into Instagram. 
    
## Javscript Libraries Used
    $ This project would not have been possible without the help of the following Javascript libraries
    $$ JIMP: To square the images
    $$ JSZip: To store squared images for download
    $$ Filesaver: To download the zip file created by JSZip
